# Assignment-3

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function.

It takes an interger as input from the user. First function is defined as factorial with an argument 'n'. Using recursion factorial of the integer is calculated. If-else statement is used for condition when (n<2) it returns 1 otherwise it  will return n*factorial(n-1). Then we call the function and the result is displayed.


Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations.

It takes an interger as input from the user. Math module is used to calculate square root - sqrt(n), natural log - log(n,e), sine - sin(n). Then the result is displayed.
